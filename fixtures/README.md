# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test data and fixtures for cross-language SM algorithm testing.

## Structure

Test fixtures can include:
- Predefined test vectors for SM3 hashing
- Sample keys for SM2 and SM4 operations
- Expected outputs for validation
- Edge case test data

## Usage

Test fixtures are optional. The test runner can generate test data dynamically, but fixtures can be used for:
1. Regression testing with known good values
2. Testing edge cases and boundary conditions
3. Compliance testing with official test vectors
